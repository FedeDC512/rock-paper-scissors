# Rock Paper Scissors Game with UI

This project implemets a Rock Paper Scissors game with a User Interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players interact by selecting one of the three available buttons representing Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer's choice and the current score is displayed at the top. A "Rematch" button is provided to either start a new game or reset the current one, allowing players to play multiple rounds without reloading the page. Each game consists of 5 rounds. After each match, the outcome (win or loss) for the player is announced near the final score. Additionally, a log section displays all the actions and results throughout the game.
